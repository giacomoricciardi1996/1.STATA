**Task Overview**:  Data extracted from the Survey of Consumer Finances, 1989-2016 with year, demographic characteristics, income, housing assets, total assets, housing debt, and total debt. For all questions in this task, wealth is defined as assets minus debt. All variables have already been rescaled into 2016 $. No additional data is needed.

**Questions**
    
    1.  Please summarize key trends in median total wealth over the last 30 years by race and education using plots and in writing.
        
    2.  Repeat your analysis for just median housing wealth for black and white households.
        
    3.  Many households are not homeowners and so your analysis for the prior question includes many zeros for housing wealth. Letâ€™s dig deeper by focusing just on homeowners age 25 or older. Subsetting to homeowners age 25 or older, please summarize trends in median housing and non-housing wealth for black and white households. Which group had the largest loss in housing wealth, where 2007 is defined as the base period? Please answer this question both in dollar terms and in proportional terms.
        
    4.  Many potential channels have been identified for explaining the wealth gaps by race documented in question 1. These include differences in access to financial markets, segregation, discrimination, family networks, neighborhood characteristics, and barriers to human capital accumulation. Please pick at least two hypotheses (they do not need to be included in the list above) and explain what evidence you might want to assemble to test the importance of these channels.
